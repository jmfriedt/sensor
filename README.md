Source code for a wireless acoustic sensor short range RADAR reader I used to develop. 15 years of time wasted
on a useless application ... just in case someone can figure out how to make good use of it. Good luck.
If interested enough feel free to reach me, email address easily found on the internet, blueprint for PCBs and prototypes still available if interested.
